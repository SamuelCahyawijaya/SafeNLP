# Contributing

This project welcomes contributions and suggestions.

## Pull request review

Pull requests to this repo will be reviewed, at a minimum, by the Open Source Programs Office at
Microsoft, as well as a set of Microsoft's "Open Source Champs", for guidance.

Please understand that these templates often need to be kept rather simple, since
they are a starting point, and if there is too much guidance, teams may not be familiar
with how to react and manage projects with too much initial content.

## Contribution requirements

Most contributions require you to agree to a
Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have the right to, and actually do, grant us
the rights to use your contribution. For details, visit https://cla.opensource.microsoft.com.

When you submit a pull request, a CLA bot will automatically determine whether you need to provide
a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., status check, comment). Simply follow the instructions
provided by the bot. You will only need to do this once across all repos using our CLA.
